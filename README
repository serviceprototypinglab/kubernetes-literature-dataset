The "Kubernetes Literature Dataset" (3rd generation)

This dataset is produced by the scripts of the "Serverless Literature
Dataset". Therefore, the SLD needs to be downloaded first and this
folder needs to be placed into it in order to use the scripts when
adding new entries or producing statistics.
